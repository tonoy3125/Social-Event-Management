# Added Features of this project

- User Authentication: Users can log in to the website by their email google and github, and their profile picture and name are displayed in the navbar when logged in. A "Log Out" button allows them to log out.

- Registration Toggle: Users can easily switch between the login and registration pages, simplifying the process of creating an account.

- Password Visibility: Password input fields include an eye icon for users to toggle the visibility of their password.

- Service Details: On the homepage, there are 6 service cards, each with a "Details" button. Clicking this button leads to a private route with full details about the selected service. Access to this page is restricted to logged-in users.

- Private Routes: The "Gallery" and "Booking" routes in the navbar are private, meaning that users who are not logged in are redirected to the login page if they attempt to access them.

- Login Redirection: Users who are not logged in and attempt to access the "Details" page or private routes are redirected to the login page forÂ authentication.
